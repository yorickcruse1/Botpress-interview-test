# Overview

This is a simple, static HTML website with a clean, modern structure. The project provides a basic foundation for a web presence with semantic HTML markup, responsive CSS styling, and interactive JavaScript functionality. It follows standard web development practices with separated concerns - HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, and JavaScript for behavior.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Static Site Structure**: Built using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any frameworks or build tools
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper HTML5 semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, footer) for better accessibility and SEO
- **Responsive Design**: Implements mobile-first responsive design principles with flexible layouts
- **Component-Based CSS**: Organized stylesheet with modular sections for different page components

## Design Patterns
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with JS adding interactive enhancements
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: JavaScript uses event listeners for user interactions and page lifecycle events
- **Sticky Navigation**: Header remains visible during scroll with dynamic shadow effects
- **CSS Reset**: Implements universal reset for consistent cross-browser rendering

## File Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between HTML structure (`index.html`), styles (`css/styles.css`), and behavior (`js/script.js`)
- **Modular Structure**: Ready for expansion with organized directory structure for assets
- **Standard Web Practices**: Follows conventional file naming and organization patterns

## Styling Approach
- **Modern CSS**: Uses system fonts, flexbox for layout, and CSS custom properties approach
- **Consistent Spacing**: Implements consistent margin and padding scales
- **Accessibility**: Maintains proper color contrast and semantic structure
